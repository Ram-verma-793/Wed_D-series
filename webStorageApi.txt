------------------------------Web Storage API :


The Web Storage API provides a way for web applications to store and
retrieve data locally within a user's browser.
There are two main mechanisms provided by the Web Storage API:

1) local storage
2) session storage


++++++++++++++++++++++ Local storage :


• It is a mechanism provided by the Web Storage API which does the same thing as session storage,
but persists the data even if the browser is closed and reopened, and even if the user's computer is
shutdown and restarted.
• Stores data with no expiration date.
• Developers can use 'localStorage' object in JS to interact with local storage.
• In 'localStorage' object there are methods to store and retrieve data :
- setltem('key' , 'value') - for storing data in local storage
- getltem('key') -for retrieving data from local storage
- removeltem('key')
- for removing a specific item from local storage.

+++++++++++++S ession storage :


• It is a mechanism provided by the Web Storage API for storing key-value pairs, but the data is only
available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page
reloads) .
• Data stored in session storage is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.
• Developers can use 'sessionStorage' object in JS to interact with session storage.
• In 'sessionStorage' object there are methods to store and retrieve data :
- setltem('key' , 'value') - for storing data in session storage
- getltem('key') -for retrieving data from session storage
- removeltem('key')
- for removing a specific item from session storage.
